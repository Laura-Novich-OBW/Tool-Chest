Technical communiators, especially those using a Docs as Code philosophy, use many tools. This repository gives a summary and review of the more well known and possibly less well known tools. 

For the 2023 Technical Communications GitHub project we created content about tools in the following areas:

* [Authoring](AuthoringTools/readme.md)
* [Publishing](Publishing-tools/readme.md)
* [Repository](RepositoryTools/readme.md)
* [Content Management](Content_Management_Tools/readme.md)
