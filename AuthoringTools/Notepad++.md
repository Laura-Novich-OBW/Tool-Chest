## `Learning Curve`    

The difficulty level of learning to use Notepad++ depends on your prior experience with text editors and programming languages.  In general, it is designed to be a beginner-friendly code editor, with features, such as, syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and plugins that can enhance your coding experience. However, Notepad++ is not an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and as such does not have built-in tools for compiling, debugging, or running code.  As a result, users have to install additional software for these tasks, depending on the language that you are using.
