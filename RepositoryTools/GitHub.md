## Description
GitHub is a cloud-based platform and service for software development and version control that uses Git. It follows a distributed version control model and provides access control, task management, bug tracking, and much more for every project.
## Learning Curve
One method of using GitHub is through GitHub's GUI (graphic user interface). You can learn how to use it by taking GitHub's interactive courses that walk you through all the basics. Some commands in GitHub are a bit counter-intuitive, so it may take time getting used to.    

Another method of using GitHub is on a CLI (command line interface). This has a steeper learning curve than the GUI and is not as intuitive, but it does provides more features and better help resources.
## Cost
The basic version of GitHub is free, but it can cost between $4/user per month and $21/user per month for additional features and security.
## Required OS
GitHub works on most major operating systems, such as: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
## Advantages
* **Easy Collaboration**  
  GitHub uses a distributed system that lets each collaborator work on a separate branch and later merge the branch to the central repository. This makes it easy for team members from around the world to work on a project.
* **Version Control**  
  GitHub allows users to keep track of changes to their work over time and makes it easy to revert to previous versions if necessary. This allows you to write many draft versions of your work, without worrying about losing the changes.
* **Great Documentation**  
  The GitHub website has clear, comprehensive documentation that can help you with anything git-related without needing to look anywhere else.
## Disadvantages
* **Difficult for Beginners**  
   GitHub can have a steep learning curve due to its unintuitive commands, inconsistencies, and arguments in the software.
* **Security**  
  Since GitHub is cloud-based, even its private repositories are vulnerable to third-party attacks. That is why some employers only allow work to be done on a secure internal Git. 
* **Pricing**  
 Some of Git's features are locked behind an SaaS paywall. If you have a large team, the price of using the repository with these features can add up fast.
