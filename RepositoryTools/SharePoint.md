## Description
SharePoint is a web-based collaboration tool that enables teams to create and manage content. It integrates with Microsoft Office, and the cloud-based version is part of Microsoft 365. 

## Learning Curve
Since it uses common Microsoft tools like Word and Excel, people tend to learn SharePoint fairly easily. There are plenty of collaboration features that take a bit of time to learn, but they offer a lot of training and documentation.

## Cost
It ranges from $6/month to $22/month.

## Required OS
An on-premises SharePoint server is usually on a Windows OS.  
The cloud-based version (SharePoint Online) can be accessed using a web browser on any OS.

## Advantages
- Integrates with Microsoft tools most people are already familiar with
- Powerful search options within a potentially huge repository
- Security tools, including encryption, permissions management, and compliance tools
- Easy to start working "out of the box"

## Disadvantages
- No free version
- Costly to set up on-premises server and can be costly over time for the cloud-based server
- Can be hard to learn for those who don't use Microsoft tools already
- Meant more for documents, less for code collaboration
- Only one person can edit at a time
